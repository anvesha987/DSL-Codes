Problem Statement: 
a) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of students in array who attended training program in random order.
   Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Linear and Sentinal Search.

b) Write a python program to store roll numbers of students in array who attended training program in sorted order.
   Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Binary and Fibonacci Search.
